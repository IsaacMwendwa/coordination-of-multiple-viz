## Introduction
This repo contains the code for a dashboard of coordinated, interactive visualizations, implemented in D3.js. I chose a grocery-store-survey dataset for this project. The visualization graphs used in this dashboard are a histogram, a heatmap, a density plot, and a scatter plot.
The dataset used can be found at: https://github.com/IsaacMwendwa/dataViz-datasets
