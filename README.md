## Current App Link: https://grocery-store-visualizations.herokuapp.com

## Introduction
This repo contains the code for a dashboard of coordinated, interactive visualizations, implemented in D3.js. I chose a grocery-store-survey dataset for this project. The visualization graphs used in this dashboard are a histogram, a heatmap, a density plot, and a scatter plot.
The dataset used can be found at: https://github.com/IsaacMwendwa/dataViz-datasets

## Installation
No installation of packages is needed, as I directly link to the hosted D3.js script

## Usage
Ensure you have Internet connectivity, and double-click the index.html file to open it on a browser, so as to view the visualizations
